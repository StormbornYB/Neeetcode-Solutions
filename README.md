My solutions in Go for problems on Neetcode.io

# What is NeetCode?

NeetCode is a platform for learning algorithms and data structures, that provides clean, effective and
easy to understand and implement solutions.

By the time I write this, NeetCode has over **433+** solutions to a wide range of problems.
Sadly, not all of them are written in Go.

So, my goal with this repo is to provide concise, clean and effective solutions for algorithmic problems you can find on
Leetcode.
It will definitely be helpful for people preparing to technical interviews in Go, newbie-Gophers, etc.

If you are not familiar with NeetCode, make sure to visit
